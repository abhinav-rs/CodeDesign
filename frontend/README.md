# **Code Export Popup Component**

A responsive and interactive modal popup component built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This component allows users to choose between different code export formats (HTML/CSS and Next.js) through a clean, tabbed interface.

## **Features**

* **Interactive Popup:** A modal that appears on a button click.  
* **Dark Theme:** Modern, dark-themed UI for a professional look.  
* **Tabbed Interface:** Easily switch between different export options using pill-style tabs.  
* **Custom Controls:** Includes custom-styled checkboxes and icons for a polished user experience.  
* **User-Friendly:**  
  * Closes when the 'Escape' key is pressed.  
  * Closes when clicking on the background overlay.  
  * Stationary download button for easy access regardless of the selected tab.

## **File Structure**

The project is organized into three main files:

* index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the popup and its elements.  
* styles.css: Defines all the styles for the layout, theme, and custom components.  
* script.js: Handles all the JavaScript logic for showing/hiding the popup, tab switching, and updating the download button text.

## **How to Run**

1. **Download the Files:** Make sure you have index.html, styles.css, and script.js in the same directory.  
2. **Add Assets:** Place the required image assets in the same directory:  
   * x.png (for the close button)  
   * HTML.png (for the HTML & CSS tab)  
   * BRAND.png (for the Next JS tab)  
3. **Open in Browser:** Open the index.html file in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

That's it\! You can now interact with the "EXPORT CODE" button to see the popup in action.
